# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to give an overall of students performace of standarized tests in math and reading from various public schools in the state of Colorado. We have conducted this project by using Jupyter Notebook, a software that inherits a python library that creates dataframes called Pandas.

# Overview of The School District Analysis
The School Board in the State of Colorado has notified one of the principals of the School that the file students_complete.csv shows altered reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. We observe that if the data shows a significant amount of change if we ignore the scores generated by the Thomas High School ninth graders. We have conducted our findings using Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computational enviornment for creating notebook documents. 


# Results
In this project, we are observing how the data is changed overall when we eliminate the ninth grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. From the change in the data, this is what we have observed. 

   ### 1. How is the district summary affected? 
   These were the following results displayed for the school district summary. The first results is the district summary before the scores for Thomas High School were removed. The results is shown below.

This is the results for the district summary shown below, but the reading and mathematics scores for Thomas High School were removed. There is a change of percentage of passing scores for the district.

### 2. How is the school summary affected? 
From the previous results, we see that there was a percent decrease in passing scores when the ninth grade test scores were removed. However, there was only a minor percent decrease. We expect to see a different reusult for the school summary. Shown below is the school summary before the scores from Thomas High School were removed.

Here is the similar school summary data frame with the scores from Thomas High School removed.

Comparing both data frames, we see there is a minor percent decrease of passing scores for reading, math, and overall passing. There is not a change in the data. To prove this, we have printed out the top five performing schools in the district. Here are the data frames displaying the top five schools in the distict without the scores removed.
