# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to give an overall of students performace of standarized tests in math and reading from various public schools in the state of Colorado. We have conducted this project by using Jupyter Notebook, a software that inherits a python library that creates dataframes called Pandas.

# Overview of The School District Analysis
The School Board in the State of Colorado has notified one of the principals of the School that the file students_complete.csv shows altered reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. We observe that if the data shows a significant amount of change if we ignore the scores generated by the Thomas High School ninth graders. We have conducted our findings using Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computational enviornment for creating notebook documents. 


# Results
In this project, we are observing how the data is changed overall when we eliminate the ninth grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. From the change in the data, this is what we have observed. 

### 1. How is the district summary affected?
