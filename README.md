# School_District_Analysis

This is our project searching for percent changes before or after test scores have been removed because of suspicion of acadmemic dishonesty. 

# Overview of The School District Analysis 

The school board has informed the chief data scientist, Maria, and here supervisor about the fife, "students_complete.csv" showing evidence of academic dishonesty for Thomas High School ninth graders. In this project, we observe if the data presents a significant change if the scores of Thomas High School ninth graders are removed. Through the duruation of data cleansing and research, we have used Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based computing platform which combines live coding and manipulation of dataframes. Through this software, we have used Python to compute our findings.  

# Results

In this project, we observe how the reading and math scores are affection given the following scenarios 

#### 1. How is the district summary affected? 

We have found a minor change in the dataframes before and after the Thomas High School ninth graders' test scores were removed. Here is dataframes displaying the district summary before the Thomas High School ninth grader test scores are removed

Here is the district summary dataframe after the scores for Thomas High School ninth graders are removed:

From these two dataframes, there is a minor decrease in percentages passing in math, reading, and the overall percentage.  

#### 2. How is the school summary affected?

Based on the data clensing, we have found a small percent decrease in the passing math, reading and overall percentage of passing scores. What is interesting is that the Average Reading Score for Thomas High School has increased after the Thomas High School test scores for ninth graders were removed. 

Here is the data frame displaying the school summaries in the district before the scores from the Thomas High School ninth graders were removed.

Here is the similar dataframe after the test scores from the Thomas High School ninth graders were removed.

Notice that the Average Reading Score from Thomas High School has increased. Otherwise, the overall the passing percentages for math, reading, and overall have decreased only a small amount. 

#### 3. How does replacing ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schools performance relative to the other schools? 

Since there was a minor decrease in percentage of passing math, reading, and overall passing, this decrease did not reflect their school ranking as one of top five performing schools. 

Here is the dataframe representing the high performing schools in the district without the Thomas High School ninth graders test scores removed. This was sorted by the passing overall percent from highest to lowest.

Here is the similar dataframe with the scores removed. 

<img width="864" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-10 at 12 31 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104328106/178157724-16a2668b-ba21-47d9-9066-b44c758af73b.png">

Since there was little percent change from the scores by Thomas High School, it did not reflect their ranking whatsoever. 

#### 4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: 


##### a. Math and Reading Scores By Grade
Obviously, we have removed the scores for ninth graders from Thomas High School. Here are the dataframes representing the average test scores for math and reading for each school based on grade level. These dataframes are displayed before the scores from the Thomas High School ninth graders are removed. 

###### Math Scores By Grade Level:

###### Reading Scores By Grade Level: 


<img width="352" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-10 at 12 46 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104328106/178158006-c4fa5f84-6aeb-4e8c-91e9-30856368ebb1.png">


Here are the similar dataframes with the math and reading score from Thomas High School ninth graders removed. This is indicated as a 'NaN' entry in the respective dataframes. 


##### Math Scores By Grade Level (Refined):

##### Reading Scores By Grade Level (Refined): 

<img width="409" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-10 at 12 51 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104328106/178158148-2320e2b7-9326-4e70-a0ac-865e6f099fc7.png">

After the removial of the grades, there seems to be no change in the data at all. 



#### b. Scores By School Spending 
In this scenario, we have created four groups to label each school in the district based on spending per student. Thomas High School has a student spending in between $631 and $645 per student. 

Here is the data frame displaying the test scores in regards to spending ranges per student, without removing the test scores made by Thomas High School ninth graders. 


<img width="707" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-10 at 12 59 37 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104328106/178158365-2c347cd4-46f0-4f5a-bb4a-8aafcc37ef91.png">

Here is the similar dataframe with the test scores made by Thomas High School ninth graders removed. 

<img width="701" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-10 at 12 59 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104328106/178158384-52d1aecd-0bd4-46d8-a075-7500a37ffeaa.png">


#### c. Scores By School Size
In this scenario, we have generated a similar method creating groups as the previous part. This time, we have created groups representing school size. According to the school board, there are three types of school sizes: small (less than 1000 students), medium (between 1000 to 1999 students), and large (between 2000 to 5000 students). Thomas High School is classified as an medium sized school. 

Here is the following dataframe representing passing test scores by school size without the scores made by Thomas High School ninth graders removed.

Here is the similar dataframe but the score made by Thomas High School ninth graders are removed.

#### d. Scores By School Type

Finally, in this situation, we have grouped the data as like the previous two parts. This time, we are gouping the school by school type. According to the school board, each high school in the district is classified by two types. They are ordinary district schools or charter schools. Thomas High School is classified as a charter school. 

Here is the dataframe representing the test scores by school type without the test scores made by Thomas High School ninth graders removed.

# Summary

There were some significant changes that we have observed before and after removing the test scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. 

First, in the school district summary, the average math score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and the percent passing overall has increased. However, the average reading scores remained the same. 

Second, in the school summary dataframes, the average math score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and percent passing overall showed a small decrease in percentages. However, the average reading score data point showed a small increase between the two dataframes. 

Third, in the data frames displaying the test scores by school size, there was a small increase in percent value between average math score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and percent overall passing. There was a percent decrease of average reading scores between the two dataframes. 

Finally, in the data frames representing percentages passing by School Type, the district school values were kept the same. However, there is a percent decrease of average math scores, percent passing math, and percent passing overall. There is a percent increase in average reading scores between the two datasets as well.
