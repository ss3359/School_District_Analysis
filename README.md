# School_District_Analysis

This is our project searching for percent changes before or after test scores have been removed because of suspicion of acadmemic dishonesty. 

# Overview of The School District Analysis 

The school board has informed the chief data scientist, Maria, and here supervisor about the fife, "students_complete.csv" showing evidence of academic dishonesty for Thomas High School ninth graders. In this project, we observe if the data presents a significant change if the scores of Thomas High School ninth graders are removed. Through the duruation of data cleansing and research, we have used Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based computing platform which combines live coding and manipulation of dataframes. Through this software, we have used Python to compute our findings.
